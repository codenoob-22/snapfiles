## snapchat for files 
 In this project i aimed to create a secure file transfer system in which a user uploads a file and is given a unique token which he can share with his friend, That friend can put this token into validator, Once validated the token_id, file will get downloaded on his system. And also the validity of this token is only restricted to one use.
